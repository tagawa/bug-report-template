# Bug Report Template (Browser Extension)

A browser extension to quickly add a simple bug report template to text areas. It saves time and makes bug reports consistent.

## How to use:

1. Install extension (see below)
2. Right-click in an editable text area
3. Click "Insert bug report template" &mdash; that's it!

## Downloads/Installation

* Firefox (48+): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/bug-report-template/
* Vivaldi/Opera/Chrome: https://github.com/tagawa/bug-report-template/raw/master/builds/bug-report-template.crx

## Todo

* Don't display the context menu label on `input` elements.
* Don't insert the template if the text box is less than a certain height (e.g. one line high).
